Simple Basketball Sim

Currently this is an extremely naive basketball simulation that only uses a few variables (usage, three-point rate, shooting percentages) to simulate an NBA game. The players contained in heat.csv and spurs.csv are representations of the teams that played in the 2013-14 NBA Finals.

Assumptions:
<ul>
<li>All you can do on the court is shoot, pass, rebound and commit turnovers<\li>
<li>All rebounding is uniform. "Bigs" rebound better than "Smalls."<\li>
</ul>
